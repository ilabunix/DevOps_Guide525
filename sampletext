I completed the failover simulation in UAT by deregistering all targets from the East ALB target group (sac-downloader-tg), which effectively left the East ALB with no healthy backends.

Expected: Akamai should detect East as unhealthy and shift traffic to the West ALB.
Observed: Traffic continued to route to East, and CloudWatch metrics still showed activity there. West ALB metrics did not increase.

Analysis:
	•	The East ALB itself was still reachable on port 443, so Akamai may not be treating it as “down.”
	•	It’s also possible that Akamai’s health check path/status is configured differently, or that West has not been set as an active failover origin in the current Akamai property.

Next Steps / Options to Test Further:
	1.	Confirm with Akamai team which origin health check is configured (path/status codes) and whether West is wired in as the failover origin for this UAT property.
	2.	Alternative simulation: Instead of only deregistering targets, we can temporarily block inbound 443 on the East ALB security group. This would prevent Akamai from completing TLS to East, which should be detected as a hard failure and force reroute to West.
	3.	If West is confirmed as configured, re-run the test after the Akamai team validates health check settings.
