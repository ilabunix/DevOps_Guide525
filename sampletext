Thanks for the detailed explanation — that makes sense.

You’re correct — CloudFront is currently configured with a custom origin pointing to downloads.uat.frbservices.org, which means it’s forwarding the full legacy path to Akamai. Since Akamai security policies rely on validating the end-user IP and not intermediary proxies, that approach isn’t ideal long-term.

We’ll move forward with your recommended solution — removing the custom origin and implementing an HTTP 301 permanent redirect within CloudFront for the /distribution/client/fla/* and /distribution/client/flw/* paths. This will ensure browsers connect directly to Akamai while maintaining the legacy URLs until user communication and decommissioning occur next year.

I’ll create a lightweight CloudFront Function to handle this redirect logic and deploy it in the UAT distribution for validation before promoting to higher environments.
