Scope

Develop and validate a GenAI-powered assistant that provides operational troubleshooting guidance for cloud-based systems. The assistant will:
	•	Retrieve answers from existing playbooks and runbooks.
	•	Support engineers with structured, step-by-step troubleshooting recommendations.
	•	Reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) during incidents.
	•	Provide a chat-based interface for ease of use, integrated within the AWS console (and optionally Microsoft Teams/S3-hosted UI).

Target users: Cloud engineers, Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), and Operations teams.

⸻

Business Need

Current troubleshooting processes are time-consuming, requiring engineers to manually search across Confluence, logs, and monitoring tools.
	•	This leads to delays in resolving incidents and inconsistent use of best practices.
	•	GenAI offers a solution to streamline knowledge retrieval and make troubleshooting guidance instantly available.

Ideal state: Engineers ask the chatbot questions like “What caused the last outage of App X?” or “How do I restart a failed Lambda deployment?” and receive contextual, actionable responses.

Business Value / Benefits (incl. measurements)

Immediate Benefits
	•	Reduced MTTR for production incidents.
	•	Faster onboarding of new engineers through AI-assisted troubleshooting.
	•	Consistent application of operational playbooks.

Future Benefits
	•	Broader adoption across multiple business units for cross-application support.
	•	Potential integration with automation workflows (self-healing systems).
	•	Knowledge retention even when SMEs leave.

Benefits to the System
	•	Standardized troubleshooting across the Federal Reserve System.
	•	Reduced risk of inconsistent or delayed response to critical outages.
	•	Improved system resilience and operational efficiency.

⸻

Efficiencies Reinvestment

Efficiencies gained from faster incident resolution will be reinvested into:
	•	Expanding monitoring and automation coverage.
	•	Enhancing runbooks and playbooks with AI-driven insights.
	•	Freeing engineers to focus on higher-value engineering tasks instead of repetitive troubleshooting.

⸻

Risks
	•	Model accuracy risk: Potential for incorrect or incomplete responses. Mitigation: Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with curated playbooks.
	•	Data security risk: Sensitive operational data exposure. Mitigation: All data remains within AWS (no external AI services).
	•	Adoption risk: Engineers may prefer existing manual methods. Mitigation: Provide training and demonstrate value with POC success metrics.

⸻

Assumptions, Constraints, Dependencies
	•	AWS Bedrock (Claude Sonnet + Titan Embeddings) will be available and approved for internal use.
	•	Playbooks and runbooks will be hosted in S3 (temporary for POC, with possible migration to Confluence or central KB later).
	•	Requires integration with AWS accounts (CloudWatch, Lambda, API Gateway).
	•	Dependency on IAM roles, KMS encryption, and data classification approvals.

⸻

Resources

Development Team
	•	CloudOps engineers (you + TIGER team)
	•	Security engineers (for IAM/KMS reviews)
	•	Solutions Architects (for integration reviews)

Ongoing Production Support
	•	Ops engineers, ADTs, and monitoring teams.

⸻

Cost Estimates

Development Labor Cost
	•	Internal CloudOps team effort for 2–3 months POC.

Software Cost
	•	AWS Bedrock usage (token-based pricing).
	•	OpenSearch Serverless for embeddings.
	•	Minimal S3 storage + Lambda/API Gateway usage.

⸻

Solution / Architecture Approach
	•	RAG-based chatbot architecture using AWS Bedrock + OpenSearch + Lambda.
	•	Secure S3 bucket for storing knowledge base documents.
	•	API Gateway fronting Lambda functions (indexer + query).
	•	DynamoDB (optional) for chat history and audit.
	•	KMS encryption and IAM roles for least privilege.

⸻

Security Posture
	•	FedRAMP controls applied to AWS GovCloud/Commercial.
	•	MFA enforced for all privileged roles.
	•	Encryption at rest (KMS) and in transit (TLS).
	•	No external data sharing (all processing within AWS).

⸻

End Users
	•	CloudOps engineers
	•	Application Dev Teams (ADTs)
	•	Technology Operations (TechOps)
	•	Future expansion: Business SMEs (via Teams interface)
