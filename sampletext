Implementation Plan

Install Plan

No code deployment. Manual artifact upload + parameter update.

Release Playbook

Pre-deployment Steps
	1.	Confirm change window is open and all required approvals are in place.
	2.	Validate access to:
	•	S3 buckets in us-east-1 and us-west-2
	•	AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (both regions)
	3.	Download the approved SAC client ZIP files to your workstation.
	4.	Generate/verify the SHA-256 checksum for each ZIP file.

Deployment Steps
	1.	Upload SAC Client ZIP Files to S3
	•	Navigate to the target S3 bucket in us-east-1.
	•	Upload the new SAC client ZIP file into the appropriate folder/path.
	•	Repeat the upload in us-west-2 bucket.
	2.	Update Parameter Store Checksums
	•	Locate the Parameter Store entries containing the checksum value (one per region).
	•	Update the parameter’s value with the new SHA-256 checksum.
	•	Save and confirm the updated version in both regions.
	3.	Validation
	•	Validate the S3 objects show the correct upload timestamp and size.
	•	Confirm the checksum value in Parameter Store matches the newly uploaded file.
	•	Confirm expected application/API health checks remain stable.

Test / Verification Plan
	1.	Trigger or wait for the application to retrieve the updated SAC client from S3 (based on app behavior).
	2.	Confirm the application successfully reads the updated checksum from Parameter Store.
	3.	Validate there are no 4XX/5XX CloudWatch alarms for the application components.
	4.	Engage ADT team (if applicable) to confirm no regression in client connectivity or customer flows.
	5.	Monitor logs for 10–15 minutes to ensure no checksum mismatch or S3 access errors.

Backout (Rollback) Plan

If any issue arises:
	1.	Restore Previous ZIP Files
	•	Re-upload the previous known-good SAC client ZIP file to S3 (both regions).
	•	Overwrite or rename the object depending on bucket structure.
	2.	Revert Parameter Store Checksum
	•	Open Systems Manager Parameter Store.
	•	Select the previous version of the checksum parameter.
	•	Use “Revert to previous version” or manually paste the last known-good checksum value.
	3.	Validation
	•	Confirm S3 contains the old ZIP file.
	•	Confirm Parameter Store shows the previous checksum version.
	•	Monitor logs and CloudWatch alarms for stability.
	4.	Notify stakeholders once rollback is completed and systems are stable.
