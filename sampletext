Update:
The team has completed validation in the lower environment. Lawrence applied a database script to remove the impacted link and recycled the server, confirming the resolution. This approach avoids introducing additional code tied to future functionality while resolving the current error. We will proceed with an off-cycle production deployment tonight, which will involve executing the same database script in production and performing JVM restarts to apply the fix. This is expected to fully resolve the issue.

Business Impact:
Impact remains low â€” currently only two requests have been affected by this issue.
