Final Update:
The configuration for the weekly RA Report cycle has been updated to run on Thursdays.
Following the change, the UIM JVMs were restarted, and validation checks have passed.

A roundtrip test was also performed to confirm end-to-end flow between FLH → EPOD → UIM → FLH, and results were successful.

No further issues observed — systems are operating normally. Incident can be closed pending final monitoring.
