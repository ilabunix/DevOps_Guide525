Update:
The team is currently validating a fix in the lower environment. Lawrence is applying a database script to remove the impacted link and recycling the server to confirm the resolution. If successful, the same script will be executed in production to address the issue. This approach will avoid introducing the additional code tied to future functionality while resolving the current error. Deployment will proceed once validation in lower environment is successful.
