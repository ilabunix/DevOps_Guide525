The team has concluded that the issue was triggered by a data mismatch starting from August 5th, which exposed edge cases in how UIM interacts with data containing unexpected or outdated formats.

âœ… Actions Taken (08/06/2025):
	â€¢	JVM restarts were performed across UIM and FedLine Provisioning Engine.
	â€¢	Teams bypassed the problematic August 5th data range and confirmed newer data (from August 6 onward) is processing as expected.
	â€¢	Configuration files were manually updated and copied across both servers.
	â€¢	A rolling restart was initiated with updated settings to verify processing continuity.

ðŸ”„ Next Steps (Updated for 08/07/2025):
	â€¢	Teams are checking with Lyle to determine whether the August 5th data can be fixed and processed today, rather than waiting until tomorrow.
	â€¢	If feasible, manual backfill of missing records from August 5â€“6 will proceed today.
	â€¢	Same configuration changes will be extended to the Contingency environment pending production validation.
	â€¢	Product team is also reviewing whether a code change will be required to address similar data issues going forward.
	â€¢	A watch party or touchpoint remains scheduled for early tomorrow morning to validate system health and confirm data sync success.
