Root Cause
DNS resolution issues for the regional DynamoDB service endpoints triggered the event ﻿WebProNews﻿. After resolving the DynamoDB DNS issue, AWS services began recovering, but a small subset of internal subsystems continued to be impaired, requiring AWS to temporarily throttle some impaired operations such as EC2 instance launches ﻿WebProNews﻿.
Impacted AWS Services (US-EAST-1 Region)
Core Infrastructure:
	•	DynamoDB - Primary trigger; DNS resolution failure
	•	EC2 - Instance launch failures, throttling applied during recovery
	•	Lambda - Function execution errors
	•	SQS - Connectivity issues
	•	Amazon Connect - Service disruptions
	•	IAM - Services relying on US-EAST-1 endpoints affected
	•	DynamoDB Global Tables - Cross-region replication impacted
