We initially identified that several VIPs were incorrectly assigned to both the Blue and Green deployments, which caused the F5 controller to get into a confused state and resulted in unpredictable routing between CC-1 and CC-3. To stabilize the environment, a temporary static route was applied to force all traffic to CC-1.

The EBS team has now recreated the missing VIPs in CC-3, and routing remains stable under the static route. The plan is to remove the static route during the maintenance window on Sunday (11/23) to restore normal routing back to CC-3. No further customer impact is expected, and we’ll continue to monitor until the change is completed.
