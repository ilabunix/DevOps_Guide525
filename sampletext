🎤 CloudOps Chatbot – POC Presentation Script

⸻

🔹 Opening

“Hi everyone, today I’m excited to walk you through a Proof of Concept I’ve developed called Ask Clara – Your CloudOps Assistant.
Clara is a GenAI-powered chatbot built for operational teams. It helps engineers get instant, contextual answers from our Confluence-based playbooks and documentation – without having to dig around manually during critical incidents.”

⸻

🔹 Objective

“The goal of this POC was to prove that we could use AWS-native services to create a smart assistant that understands operational questions and answers them using our own internal runbooks, securely and reliably.”

🔹 Architecture Overview

“Let me walk you through how this works end-to-end.”

You can refer to your diagram here, or describe it like this:

🧩 Tech Stack (Layers)

1. User Interface Layer
	•	Frontend: Static HTML/CSS/JS page hosted on S3 (or used locally for demo).
	•	Interaction: The user types a question into a chat-style UI.

2. API & Invocation
	•	API Gateway: Forwards user input as JSON over HTTPS.
	•	Lambda Query Handler: Handles all logic for embedding the query, semantic search, and LLM invocation.

3. Embedding & Search Layer
	•	Titan Embeddings (via Bedrock): Converts the input into a vector.
	•	OpenSearch (Non-Serverless): Performs vector similarity search across indexed Confluence documents.

4. LLM & Answer Generation
	•	Claude 3 Sonnet (via Bedrock): Generates the natural language answer based on the matched document.
	•	Response Formatting: The Lambda packages the LLM response and returns it to the frontend.

5. Confluence Indexing
	•	Scheduled Indexer Lambda: Runs twice a day to fetch new content from Confluence.
	•	Tokenizer + Embedding: Breaks content into chunks and stores vectors in OpenSearch.

6. Monitoring
	•	CloudWatch Logs + Alarms: For Lambda observability and error tracking.

🔹 Why Confluence?

“Instead of uploading files to S3, this POC connects directly to Confluence, so it indexes live operational content. This gives us real-time knowledge retrieval from trusted internal documentation.”

⸻

🔹 Key Capabilities

“Clara can answer questions like:
✔️ ‘How to restart EC2 using SSM?’
✔️ ‘What are the steps to rollback a Lambda deployment?’
✔️ ‘How to detect a DDoS event in AWS?’
And it provides answers with actual procedural steps pulled from our internal Confluence pages.”

🔹 Demo Transition

“Let’s jump into a quick demo. I’ll show you how a user interacts with Clara, what happens behind the scenes, and how the response is generated.”

Walk through:
	•	Asking a question on the UI
	•	Showing the JSON API call
	•	Briefly explaining the embedding + search logic
	•	Returning to the answer in the UI

⸻

🔹 Future Enhancements

“Here’s what we’re looking to do next:”

	•	Role-based content filtering
	•	Multi-turn chat memory
	•	Feedback mechanism (“Was this helpful?”)
	•	Fallback to live Confluence fetch if needed

🔹 Closing

“This POC proves that GenAI can enhance operational efficiency, reduce MTTR, and eliminate guesswork during incidents. It’s built fully with AWS-native services, scalable, and secure – and it brings clarity to chaos, with Clara.”
