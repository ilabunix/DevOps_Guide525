1. What advice would you give teams who do not know where to start with AI?

“Start small and stay focused. You don’t need to build a complex AI solution from day one. Instead, identify one real-world problem — something that slows your team down or creates friction — and explore how AI could solve just that.

For us, it was the pain of digging through playbooks during incidents. That single pain point was enough to build a meaningful proof of concept.

Also, involve your stakeholders early — especially security, compliance, and architecture — so you’re building something that can scale responsibly.”

2. What strengths help you become a navigator in the AI space?

“Curiosity and persistence. AI is moving fast, and things don’t always work on the first try — so being willing to experiment, learn from failure, and adapt is key.

I also try to focus on practical value — not just what’s possible with AI, but what’s actually helpful for the people using it. That mindset has helped me stay grounded and build solutions that solve real problems.”
