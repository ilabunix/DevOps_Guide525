1. Can you share any current exploration or adoption your team is actively working on? How will this work help your team and FRFS?

Answer:

“Our CloudOps team has been exploring how GenAI can assist engineers during operational troubleshooting. One major project is Clara, a GenAI-powered assistant that retrieves step-by-step solutions from our internal playbooks hosted in Confluence.

We integrated AWS Bedrock (using Titan embeddings + Claude Sonnet), OpenSearch Vector Search, and a lightweight Lambda-based backend. The assistant is accessible via a chat interface — no login or tool-switching needed.

It’s already reducing time to resolution, especially during on-call shifts. Engineers no longer have to dig through lengthy documentation — Clara gives direct, contextual answers instantly.

This not only helps our team become more efficient but also enables quicker incident response across the Federal Reserve’s broader cloud infrastructure.”

2. Have you encountered any setbacks or challenges along the way? What key learnings have you gained from those experiences?

Answer:

“Absolutely. We faced a few roadblocks:
	•	LangChain dependency issues during early prototyping — which led us to switch to a custom lightweight implementation
	•	Confluence sandbox restrictions meant we had to simulate with an S3-based knowledge base for our POC
	•	And getting high-quality responses required trial-and-error with prompt engineering and embedding quality

Key takeaway? Start simple, test fast, and iterate. Also, clean documentation matters — because GenAI is only as good as the data you give it.”

3. What are you most excited about when it comes to AI and the potential that it could provide in years to come for your team and FRFS?

Answer:

“I’m most excited about how AI will evolve from being a ‘tool’ to becoming a virtual teammate.

We’re exploring how Clara can eventually:
	•	Guide new engineers through complex systems
	•	Auto-generate RCAs based on incident logs
	•	And even take proactive action during failures using scripted playbooks

For FRFS, this means transforming operational efficiency — making our systems more resilient, reducing MTTR, and preserving institutional knowledge in real time.”
