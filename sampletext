Subject: ContactUs Integration – Redirect and CloudFront Update

Hi [Manager’s Name],

During yesterday’s go-live call, we identified a required redirect to handle users who may still access the legacy ONPREM ContactUs page (https://www.frbservices.org/contacts/index.jsp). Without this in place, bookmarked links would result in errors.

To address this:
	•	CloudFront Change (TechOps): I will update the CloudFront path pattern behavior for /contacts/* to change the origin from ONPREM to the BloomReach ALB, so that requests are routed to Bloomreach static content.
	•	Redirect Handling (ADTs): James will configure the redirect in Bloomreach code so that legacy URLs automatically point to the new page at https://www.frbservices.org/contact.
	•	Testing Plan: We will implement and validate this change in QA this week, and plan the production update for next week after successful testing.

I wanted to bring this to your attention and seek your approval to move forward with the QA update and testing.
