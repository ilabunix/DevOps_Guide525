Update:
JVMs are currently being brought down to perform the database update, which includes updating a parameter value to this morning’s date to prevent reprocessing of last week’s data. Once the update is complete, JVMs will be restarted to resume processing.

Business impact remains moderate — FedLine Access team continues to pause processing in UIM to avoid further cursor exhaustion. No SLA impact at this time.
