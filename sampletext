I completed the manual upload of the SAC client zip files to the S3 buckets in both regions and updated the corresponding checksum values in Parameter Store.

The original instructions from the Clev team suggested generating the SHA256 checksum locally (using Git Bash) and updating Parameter Store prior to uploading. However, this did not work as expected — the Lambda quarantine workflow moved the uploaded objects into the quarantine folder because the checksum didn’t match what Lambda computed.

Upon checking CloudWatch logs, I found that Lambda was validating against the full-object checksum generated after multipart upload, which differs from the locally generated checksum.

To resolve this:
	1.	I uploaded the files first.
	2.	Observed the Lambda-logged checksum value for each file (full-object checksum).
	3.	Updated the Parameter Store entries using those expected values.
	4.	Verified the files were released from quarantine and successful in both regions.

Everything is now complete and aligned with the SAC workflow.
