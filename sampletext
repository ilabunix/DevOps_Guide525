While I understand that the subnets were expanded from /28 to /25 on your end, I’d like to clarify how this impacts us from the AWS side.

In AWS WAF, IPSets must explicitly list the allowed IPs or CIDR ranges. The original /28 ranges (10.49.68.144/28 and 10.49.196.144/28) were previously added to the WAF IPSet, which allowed access from only those specific addresses.

Now that the subnets have changed to:
	•	10.49.68.128/25
	•	10.49.196.128/25

Any traffic originating from IPs outside the old /28 blocks but within the new /25 range will be blocked by WAF unless the new /25 CIDRs are explicitly added to the WAF IPSet.

So even though the range was expanded on your end, from the AWS WAF perspective, it doesn’t automatically accept the broader range unless we update it. That’s why previously working environments (like QA) are now blocked.

We’ll proceed with updating the WAF IPSet to include the new /25 ranges.
