Follow-up Update – INC1530XXX

EUS did not identify any user-side cause and EMSS was engaged to review MQ/JMS behavior. No specific MQ issues were found; however, further review of DDS metrics shows the Messaging Listener Service (ddsEngineCluster – MailDeliveryBean) is exhibiting higher-than-normal processing time, which aligns with the observed delays in email processing earlier.

As a proactive measure, the team will proceed with a rolling restart of the DDS engines (66 engines in total) to stabilize processing and prevent a recurrence during upcoming activity volumes.

Next Steps:
	•	Perform rolling restart of DDS engines.
