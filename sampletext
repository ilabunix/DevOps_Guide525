Final Update:
The database parameter update was applied, and JVMs were restarted. The weekly job is no longer running, and dependent jobs have processed successfully. The audit job completed at 11:40 AM with the expected extract range of August 11th (10:15 AM – 11:45 AM). The FedLine Access team resumed processing in UIM at approximately 12:15 PM ET, and the cursor count has remained stable since.

Business Impact:
Impact was moderate — processing in UIM was paused during remediation, but no SLA impact occurred.
