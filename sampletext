Update:
ADTs are finalizing the pipeline fix and will provide deployment instructions to Release Management to execute the deployment. Tentative start time is 3:00 PM CT, pending CSC confirmation for a ~30-minute pause in processing.

Following deployment, TechOps will re-run the state machines to sync device status, and teams will validate restoration of CMCv2 â†’ CMCv1 communication.
