“Our team is currently piloting a working proof-of-concept that uses Generative AI to support operational troubleshooting. The solution helps engineers quickly access internal documentation — like runbooks and response steps — through a natural language interface.

It’s fully functional today and being tested internally, with early feedback showing that it helps reduce time spent searching for information during incidents.

While it’s not in production yet, we see strong potential for this approach to improve efficiency, speed up incident response, and eventually scale across other teams at FRFS.”
