Since the public cert is associated with the ALB, Akamai’s origin is the ALB and that’s where health checks are happening. Disabling/destroying API Gateway wouldn’t necessarily trigger failover, but removing East ALB targets/subnets will. That approach will cleanly simulate an outage for Akamai to fail traffic over to West, and we can restore East afterward without impacting Terraform state.
