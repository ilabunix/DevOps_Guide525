Incident Number: 

Issue Recap:
Emails for FedLine credential workflows were stuck in a processing state but have now started going through. EUS was engaged and did not find any user-side issues. While reviewing logs, we observed an MQ/JMS exception which may be contributing to the intermittent processing delays. We are engaging EMSS to investigate the MQ/JMS behavior further.

Services/Applications Impacted:
FedLine Web – Credential Processing / Notification Delivery

Business/Customer Impact:
Credential-related emails (including password resets and UIM notifications) were delayed, potentially preventing customers from completing credential setup or access workflows. Emails are currently flowing again, but underlying cause remains under investigation.

Next Steps:
	•	EMSS to review MQ/JMS exceptions seen during message processing.
