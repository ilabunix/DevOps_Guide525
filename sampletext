The issue is that our Lambda@Edge converts 403 errors to 404, which causes CloudFront to serve the custom 404 page externally and unintentionally reveal part of the site. As a quick fix, I’m pointing the 404 error response to our existing generic 403 page instead, so even after the rewrite, users only see the intended ‘403 Forbidden’ message.
