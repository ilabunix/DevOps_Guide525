Regarding Operational Readiness Checklist (ORC) alignment, here are some responses to the key points:
	•	Cutover Strategy:
ORC sign-off is a requirement prior to any PROD cutover, especially where TechOps support is needed for monitoring, rehydration, or rollback preparedness. We recommend each team coordinate cutover planning in advance and reference any common patterns or playbooks available. If such patterns don’t exist centrally, we can propose documenting reusable approaches based on this migration.
	•	Rehydration:
TechOps involvement in rehydration will vary by application, but the expectation is that rehydration steps (if applicable) should be documented in the app’s runbook/playbook and validated before cutover. The ORC will confirm readiness for this.
	•	Tabletop Exercises:
While full-blown documentation isn’t mandatory, running a dry run or a tabletop exercise is strongly encouraged for apps with high operational impact. These exercises help ensure everyone is aligned on roles, escalation paths, and rollback procedures.
	•	TechOps Testing Involvement:
ORC requires confirmation that TechOps has participated in functional or operational validation testing—particularly in staging or lower environments—to ensure monitoring, alerting, and recovery flows are in place.
	•	Flash Cut vs. Phased Cutover:
The ORC doesn’t prescribe the cutover type but does require that the cutover approach and rollback plan are clearly documented. If data migration is involved, we also look for validation steps and checkpoints to minimize risk.
