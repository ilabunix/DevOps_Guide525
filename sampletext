üìÅ RCA #1: PulseStack Login Failure ‚Äì July 8, 2025

Title: RCA - PulseStack Login Failure - 2025-07-08

Summary:
End users were unable to authenticate into the PulseStack platform between 08:25‚Äì09:10 CST. Login attempts returned HTTP 500 or timeout errors.

Impact:
	‚Ä¢	100% login failure across all regions
	‚Ä¢	/auth/login API returned HTTP 500s
	‚Ä¢	Tripled support ticket volume in under 30 minutes

Root Cause:
A misconfigured ALB target group caused all auth-backend instances to be marked unhealthy. The root issue was a failed NGINX startup due to a missing TLS cert reference from a recent patch.

Resolution:
	‚Ä¢	Reverted patch on auth-backend01/02
	‚Ä¢	Revalidated NGINX startup config
	‚Ä¢	Reinstated healthy targets in the ALB

Follow-Up Actions:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Add NGINX config lint check in CI/CD
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Enable health check alarms in CloudWatch

üìÅ RCA #2: PulseStack Dashboard Latency ‚Äì July 12, 2025

Title: RCA - PulseStack Dashboard Latency - 2025-07-12

Summary:
Users experienced high latency while loading dashboards in PulseStack between 10:00‚Äì11:30 CST.

Impact:
	‚Ä¢	Dashboard load time spiked from 1.2s to 5.6s
	‚Ä¢	Intermittent failures on /dashboard/summary
	‚Ä¢	Power users with large datasets experienced data fetch timeouts

Root Cause:
A background job began executing full-table joins on the production read-replica database. This job was introduced by the internal metrics team and led to high I/O latency on the replica.

Resolution:
	‚Ä¢	Disabled the reporting job immediately
	‚Ä¢	Increased read IOPS capacity on the replica
	‚Ä¢	Moved reporting to Athena queries going forward

Follow-Up Actions:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Isolate analytics workloads from transactional DB
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Add throttling guardrails to internal jobs

üìÅ RCA #3: PulseStack API 503 Errors ‚Äì July 15, 2025

Title: RCA - PulseStack Public API 503 Errors - 2025-07-15

Summary:
External and internal API users received intermittent 503 Service Unavailable errors from /v2/accounts/* between 13:10‚Äì14:05 CST.

Impact:
	‚Ä¢	503 errors from ECS public API containers
	‚Ä¢	Internal job failures and customer partner escalations
	‚Ä¢	Temporary degraded status posted on public status page

Root Cause:
An ECS deployment introduced a bad sidecar proxy config (Envoy) which broke DNS resolution for newly launched tasks. The tasks passed health checks but couldn‚Äôt reach dependent services.

Resolution:
	‚Ä¢	Rolled back to the last working ECS task definition
	‚Ä¢	Removed and replaced failed tasks
	‚Ä¢	Validated Envoy config schema against staging

Follow-Up Actions:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Add post-deploy smoke test for DNS connectivity
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Separate critical APIs from sidecar-dependent tasks

üìÅ RCA #4: PulseStack Static Asset Outage ‚Äì July 19, 2025

Title: RCA - PulseStack Static Asset Outage - 2025-07-19

Summary:
Users globally reported UI issues due to missing static files (CSS, images, JS) from 12:45‚Äì13:10 CST.

Impact:
	‚Ä¢	Login screen background missing
	‚Ä¢	Buttons and UI styling broken
	‚Ä¢	Over 90% of traffic returned CloudFront 403s or 404s for static assets

Root Cause:
An overbroad CloudFront cache invalidation (/*) during a deployment emptied the cache. The origin S3 bucket had a misconfigured IAM policy that blocked re-fetching of new assets.

Resolution:
	‚Ä¢	Restored previous S3 bucket policy
	‚Ä¢	Manually refreshed key assets into CloudFront
	‚Ä¢	Scoped cache invalidation to /static/* only

Follow-Up Actions:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Add cache simulation step to deployment pipeline
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Add alerting for spike in CloudFront 4xx errors
