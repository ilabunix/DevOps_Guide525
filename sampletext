The team has concluded that the issue was triggered by a data mismatch starting from August 5th, which exposed edge cases in how UIM interacts with data containing unexpected or outdated formats.

âœ… Actions Taken Today:
	â€¢	Multiple JVM restarts were performed across UIM and FedLine systems.
	â€¢	Teams bypassed the problematic data range and confirmed newer data (from Aug 6 onward) is processing as expected.
	â€¢	Configuration files were manually updated and copied across both servers.
	â€¢	A rolling restart was initiated with new settings to verify processing continuity.

ðŸ”„ Next Steps (Planned for 08/07/2025):
	â€¢	The team will regroup to:
	â€¢	Validate that new data is processing correctly.
	â€¢	Manually backfill missing records from Aug 5â€“6 in collaboration with Lyleâ€™s team.
	â€¢	Assess whether a code change is needed to permanently handle this data scenario.
	â€¢	A watch party or touchpoint is scheduled for early morning tomorrow to revalidate the fix.
