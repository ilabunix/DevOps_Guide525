How to Update CSP for Bloomreach

This document outlines the steps required to update the Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for the Bloomreach integration. The CSP is managed through a Lambda@Edge function that modifies HTTP headers returned from CloudFront.

⸻

Overview

The CSP headers are controlled by the hsts-header-lambda function in the us-east-1 AWS region. This Lambda function is configured on the Viewer Response of the CloudFront distribution for Bloomreach and is responsible for applying security headers.

Steps to Update CSP

1. Request InfoSec Approval

Before adding any new hostname or URL to the CSP directives, obtain approval from the InfoSec team.
Provide the following details in your request:
	•	Purpose of the domain
	•	Application name and owner
	•	Associated Jira ticket
	•	Type of directive (e.g., connect-src, frame-src, etc.)

Note: Do not proceed with changes unless approval is documented.

2. Locate the Lambda Function
	•	Go to the AWS Lambda Console in the us-east-1 region.
	•	Search and open the Lambda function: hsts-header-lambda.

3. Update the CSP Header in Code
	•	Navigate to the part of the code where response headers are set.
	•	Locate the line defining the Content-Security-Policy header.
	•	Modify the appropriate directive (connect-src, frame-src, etc.) by adding the new hostname or URL.
