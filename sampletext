I’ve been closely involved in the earlier go-live discussions and the tasks needed for testing, including the dry-run cutover validation. Since these are one-time activities specific to the go-live and ADT had requested my support earlier in the planning phase, it wouldn’t be fair to drop them on Murali while he’s on call. That’s why I volunteered to handle the CMCv2 production cutover this weekend.

I’ve been involved in the earlier go-live discussions and handled the lower environment and dry-run cutover testing. Since these are one-time tasks specific to the go-live and ADT had requested my support early on, it wouldn’t be fair to drop them on Murali while he’s on call. I can take care of the CMCv2 cutover this weekend. Also, the next two weekends are quite packed with both CMCv2 and SRAP going live this weekend, and SAC potentially next weekend.
