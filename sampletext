Hi Team,

I have completed the UAT testing for the SAC Download application in the UAT/QA environment. The testing results have been documented in the Confluence page for future reference and to support smoke testing going forward.

Regarding the Geo Restricted countries testing, I could not find an option in Pingdom to specifically select restricted countries to validate URL blocking. If we already have confirmation that Geo-fencing has been enabled for the restricted countries list (as shared in the initial Akamai integration meetings), then we should be covered on this front.

Please let me know if further validation is needed.
