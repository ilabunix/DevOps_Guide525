Thanks for raising this. As discussed in yesterday’s go-live call, the plan is for TechOps to update the CloudFront path pattern so /contacts/* traffic is routed to the Bloomreach ALB. From there, the ADT team will handle the redirect in Bloomreach code so that legacy URLs point to the new ContactUs page.

On the question of whether this should remain a long-term forward or if there’s an alternative approach, I’ve added James here since he’ll be implementing the redirect logic within Bloomreach and can provide more detail on the intended setup.

ideally, this type of redirect requirement should have been captured during the design or requirements phase since it relates to transition planning from ONPREM to Bloomreach. It surfaced during go-live discussions because the focus was primarily on functionality and cutover, and the legacy bookmark/use-case scenario wasn’t raised until then.
