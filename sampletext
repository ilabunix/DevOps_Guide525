Below is the actionable list of test cases grouped by service and alert type. ADTs should pick the alerts relevant to their application and execute the trigger action listed.

🚀 Lambda Alerts – Test Cases

Alert Name (example)
How to Trigger in DEV
Expected Result
Lambda Errors
Manually invoke Lambda with code: throw new Error("test error")
Fires if Errors > threshold
Lambda Throttles
Call a Lambda repeatedly to exceed concurrency/quota
Fires if Throttles > threshold
Lambda Duration
Add artificial delay in function (e.g., await sleep(6000))
Fires if Duration > 6000ms
Lambda Invocations
Run load test (Postman, script) to cause spike in invocations
Fires if Invocations > threshold



⸻

🌐 API Gateway Alerts – Test Cases

Alert Name
How to Trigger
Expected Result
API Gateway 5XX
Send malformed request to endpoint (e.g., missing body, auth)
Fires on 5XX
API Gateway 4XX
Send unauthorized or forbidden request (invalid token)
Fires on 4XX
API Latency > 1000ms
Add processing delay or hit a cold-start backend
Fires if p95 latency exceeds
API Request Count Spike
Run looped requests to increase traffic briefly
Fires if request count spikes
API Cache Hit Rate Low
Trigger cache miss (first-time request for a resource)
Fires if hit rate drops below threshold


🌐 ALB Alerts – Test Cases

Alert Name
How to Trigger
Expected Result
ALB Target 5XX Errors
Temporarily stop a test target (in DEV TG), then hit endpoint
Fires if backend responds with 5XX
ALB Response Time > 1s
Add delay to backend target or simulate heavy processing
Fires if average response > 1s
TLS Negotiation Errors
Access the ALB using a non-TLS-compatible client or simulate cert issue (only if safely possible)
Fires if TLS handshake fails
ALB Request Count Spike
Send high-frequency requests to ALB via script/Postman
Fires if count exceeds threshold


Execute trigger once and wait 1–2 minutes (alerts evaluate every 60s on a 5-minute window)
	•	Watch for Grafana alert state to shift from Normal → Firing


single error event within the last 5 minutes will trigger the alert, as long as it’s the most recent one in the query window.
