Just to confirm — our current CloudFront configuration for /distribution/* is already set up to forward traffic to an S3 origin in CFS1. To route this traffic toward the Akamai-hosted endpoint, we created a new custom origin (downloads.uat.frbservices.org) and updated the behavior to forward requests there.

However, CloudFront custom origins can only forward requests to a domain, not to a specific path (so we can’t append /fla or /flw directly in the origin configuration). Because of that, CloudFront is forwarding the full legacy path (e.g., /distribution/client/fla/index.html) exactly as-is to Akamai.

Since Akamai controls the downloads.uat.frbservices.org endpoint, the redirect or path mapping (from /distribution/... to /fla or /flw) would need to be handled on the Akamai edge. Once that redirect is active, CloudFront will successfully pass traffic through without any further changes needed on our side.
