I don’t think doing a full tf destroy in East is the right approach, since that would wipe out resources Terraform manages and complicate the state.

Instead, I can temporarily remove the East ALB subnets/targets using my privileged role to simulate an outage. That will cause Akamai to mark East as unhealthy and shift traffic to West. Once testing is complete, I can re-add the subnets/targets and restore East.

Since no Terraform pipelines are running for this UAT environment, there’s no risk of state conflict as long as we restore before the next apply.
