Hey! re:Invent has definitely changed a lot over the years. It’s gotten significantly bigger and more crowded than it was pre-2020, which has its pros and cons.
My honest take: if you’re a beginner to AWS, re:Invent can be a bit overwhelming. There are hundreds of sessions across multiple venues, and the logistics alone (shuttling between hotels, navigating crowds, booking sessions that fill up fast) can eat into your time.
If you do go, here’s what I’d focus on:
	•	Level 200 sessions (fundamentals) rather than 300/400 level sessions
	•	Workshops where you get hands-on practice - these tend to be more valuable than lecture-style sessions
	•	Chalk talks - smaller, more interactive sessions where you can ask questions
	•	The Expo - talk to solution architects and partners, see demos, collect swag
	•	Networking - honestly, this has become the biggest value. Meeting other practitioners, chatting with AWS folks, and making connections
But here’s the thing: Most session content gets posted online within days or weeks after the event. So if learning is your primary goal, you might get more value from watching recordings at your own pace, doing online labs, and maybe attending a local AWS meetup or a smaller regional summit.
