The rolling restart of all DDS/JMS engines has been completed successfully. Post-restart validation shows that messages are flowing normally, queued items have cleared, and MailDeliveryBean processing time has returned to expected levels. Health check files are processing as expected, including federal delivery validations.

Teams (EUS, EMSS, MSS, DDS) did not identify a definitive root cause, but based on observed MSS/Dynatrace metrics, the elevated processing time in the Messaging Listener Service was likely contributing to earlier delays. The proactive restart appears to have stabilized the environment.
