📘 CloudOps Chatbot – Proof of Concept (POC) Design (Updated)

Objective

Build a GenAI-powered CloudOps Assistant that enables engineers to ask natural language questions during incidents and receive context-aware responses from operational playbooks stored in Confluence.

The POC:
	•	Integrates with a web UI and optionally Microsoft Teams
	•	Uses Claude 3 Sonnet (via Amazon Bedrock) for answer generation
	•	Embeds documents using Titan Embeddings
	•	Stores vector data in provisioned Amazon OpenSearch
	•	Indexes content from Confluence on a scheduled basis using Lambda
	•	Is fully AWS-native

6. 🧭 Future Enhancements
	•	Display images from Confluence in chat UI
	•	Add table rendering support in HTML frontend
	•	Implement follow-up (multi-turn) context memory
	•	Use categories/tags in vector metadata for filtering
	•	Enable fallback to real-time Confluence query on miss
	•	Add feedback UI (“Was this helpful?”)
