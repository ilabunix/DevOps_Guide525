For the iframe issue — I didn’t see any alerts or alarms from the Bloomreach QA environment, and the static page itself was loading fine during that time.

Since the iframe just points to a Salesforce-hosted URL, can you confirm if the Salesforce URL was accessible directly when the issue occurred? If the page loaded but the iframe didn’t render, it likely points to an issue on the Salesforce side, not Bloomreach.

Also just to clarify — this is a cross-domain embed, so we don’t have any logging or visibility into iframe-level errors from the Bloomreach side.
