Follow-up Update â€“ INC1530650

Investigation identified that API calls to api2.federalreserve.org are failing with HTTP 500 errors after token expiry due to inability to retrieve the JWKS set from https://eapi.frb.org/.../jwks. Firewall logs show traffic from certain Tier 2 runtime IPs being denied by policy when attempting to reach the JWKS endpoint over port 443.

A production firewall change has been proposed to allow required connectivity. As this API is also used by other customers, coordination is ongoing to determine acceptable timing for the change and to validate API functionality post-update.
