We had a call this morning with the Cleveland team to review two configuration findings related to the upcoming SRAP go-live.
	1.	Dry Run Flag (PROD Environment):
	•	The DRY_RUN flag was found to be set to true, which prevents bulk notifications from being sent.
	•	The team validated that individual notifications are still being sent successfully.
	•	Since the bulk notification feature is only used once every 12 months (the next run expected in Q4 2026), this configuration does not impact the 11/09 go-live.
	•	The team plans to update this setting to false in the January release.
	2.	Adobe API Host Variable:
	•	The ADOBE_API_HOST environment variable was not explicitly set in the Lambda configuration.
	•	The code includes a default fallback value (api.na2.adobesign.com), which matches the intended endpoint.
	•	This configuration will also be explicitly added in the January release to align with deployment standards.

Pier confirmed that both items are acceptable to defer, and these findings are not considered blockers for this week’s go-live. The team will track both for correction in the January 2026 release cycle.
