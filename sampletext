Following my earlier feedback and the recent working sessions with the Cleveland team, I wanted to provide an updated view of SRAP’s LRB2 progress.

The team has made significant improvements since our initial review, especially in the areas we previously called out:
	•	Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) Alarm: The team has implemented the DLQ alarm for the Adobe synchronization process. This alert will trigger when sync failures occur, closing the major monitoring gap noted earlier.
	•	Backup and Recovery: A full backup/restore demo was conducted and documented, confirming that the procedures are now complete and validated.
	•	Playbooks and Alerts: The existing alerts for ALB, API Gateway, and Lambda continue to use AWS metric-based triggers. While the playbook steps remain somewhat high-level and generic, the team acknowledged this and committed to refining them iteratively post-go-live. At this stage, they capture the necessary workflows for basic triage and escalation.
	•	InfoSec Review (mTLS): InfoSec identified that SRAP is not currently using mTLS as originally intended. They are comfortable proceeding with deployment on the condition that the team addresses mTLS enablement post–go-live.

SRAP has also received ATO approval from InfoSec and is targeting its initial production deployment on 10/15 to establish infrastructure in CFS2. Since SRAP is not classified as a critical application, TechOps is not expected to provide after-hours triage, and any issues or alarms can be escalated to the ADT team during normal business hours.

Given the progress across key LRB2 checklist areas — documentation, backup validation, DLQ alarm creation, InfoSec alignment, and overall monitoring readiness — I believe the team has addressed the major operational gaps and is ready for LRB2 sign-off, with the understanding that further playbook refinements and mTLS implementation will follow post-deployment.
