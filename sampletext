This year, I continued to strengthen CloudOps operations while stepping into broader responsibilities around migration readiness, observability, and knowledge-sharing. Building on my mid-year achievements, I focused on enabling CFS2 adoption, ORC compliance, and production-grade monitoring and automation, while providing consistent support for deployments, quarterly activities, and cross-team troubleshooting.

Key Contributions

CFS2 Migration & ORC Readiness
	•	Participated in ORC review meetings, reviewing ADT submissions and providing feedback on areas such as monitoring, alerting, and playbook documentation. By helping ADTs align with requirements earlier in the process, I reduced rework and helped several teams achieve smoother ORC sign-off.
	•	Played a hands-on role in data migration from CFS1 to CFS2 for multiple production applications. I coordinated testing, validated post-migration functionality, and flagged issues quickly so timelines could be met without risking stability.
	•	Worked with multiple ADTs to document and test backup/restore procedures in advance of go-live. I led trial recoveries in lower environments, uncovered configuration gaps, and helped teams update their runbooks so they were fully prepared for production recovery scenarios.
	•	Acted as the main point of contact for the Cleveland ADTs, fielding questions on pipelines, deployment blockers, and monitoring gaps. This direct support accelerated their CFS2 readiness and reduced escalation delays.

Observability & Automation
	•	Transitioned from creating templates (earlier in the year) to delivering full production rollouts of Grafana dashboards and alerts for applications migrated to CFS2. This gave TechOps and ADTs a “single pane of glass” for monitoring and enabled proactive detection of performance issues.
	•	Enhanced the Terraform-based Grafana module, expanding variable support and refining alert rule logic. This allowed ADTs to onboard new services (Lambda, ALB, DynamoDB, ECS, RDS) with minimal manual setup.
	•	Conducted alert testing sessions with ADTs, demonstrating how to trigger alerts in lower environments and explaining failure condition thresholds. These sessions increased ADT confidence in monitoring and reduced misconfigured alerts in production.
	•	Collaborated with CES to integrate naming conventions and folder structures into alert definitions, ensuring alerts were consistently organized across applications and environments.

Operational & Deployment Support
	•	Provided direct support during the ContactUs integration with Bloomreach, assisting in troubleshooting production rollout issues and ensuring the integration stabilized quickly after go-live.
	•	Managed quarterly ABSNow rehydrations by coordinating smoke testing across ADTs, validating application behavior, and raising tickets for any defects found. This kept rehydration cycles predictable and ensured dependencies were in place before cutover.
	•	Supported deployments during EIAM cutovers and other high-risk transitions, coordinating across SRAP, CMCv2, and Webseal teams. I played a key role in identifying root causes during integration failures and ensuring corrective actions were taken before production cutover windows expired.
	•	Provided proactive troubleshooting across environments, frequently jumping in when ADTs encountered deployment failures or infrastructure-related blockers.

Innovation & Knowledge Sharing
	•	Led multiple CloudOps chatbot POC demos, showcasing how the solution could cut down troubleshooting time by surfacing answers directly from playbooks. These demos reached not just CloudOps, but also broader Cloud Community of Practice audiences.
	•	Worked with InfoSec and CES on the path-to-production process for the chatbot, addressing data security concerns and clarifying operational controls needed for approval.
	•	Positioned the chatbot POC as a forward-looking capability, sparking conversations around how GenAI can be safely adopted in CloudOps without adding risk.
	•	Shared best practices with peers and ADTs by walking them through new monitoring templates, pipeline setups, and troubleshooting tips. This helped drive adoption of enterprise-wide patterns instead of siloed approaches.

GitLab Repository Guidance
	•	Partnered with CES to maintain consistent repository structure and pipeline configuration for SRAP and SAC.
	•	Ensured GitLab repos aligned with NIT/CES standards, reducing issues during deployment and improving visibility across teams.
	•	Helped ADTs debug pipeline errors during CFS2 onboarding, reducing delays and keeping deployments on track.

Solutions Architecture & Regional Failover
	•	Assisted Solution Architects in reviewing regional failover designs, focusing on AWS components like Route 53, ALB, and replication strategies.
	•	Contributed operational insights (alerting, monitoring, DR validation) to design discussions, ensuring that failover approaches weren’t just architecturally sound but also operationally feasible.

Overall Impact

Throughout the year, I built on my mid-year progress by focusing on stability, readiness, and enablement. My work supported ADTs and partner teams in meeting their migration and ORC requirements, while improving observability through production dashboards and alerts.

I consistently acted as a partner and point of support, whether by assisting the Cleveland team with pipelines and monitoring, supporting Bloomreach and ABSNow with production readiness, or working with CES and InfoSec to address compliance and security considerations.

In addition, I contributed to forward-looking initiatives such as the CloudOps chatbot POC, sharing knowledge through demos and collaborating on production-readiness processes. This mix of operational support, migration enablement, and innovation strengthened CloudOps’ ability to deliver value across both day-to-day operations and long-term modernization efforts.
