candidate had a good conversation and showed strong familiarity with IAM and KMS, having worked on setting up roles and policies in her current role. Terraform knowledge was decent, though she struggled to answer questions around troubleshooting and debugging configurations. Responses on API Gateway, Lambda, and database-related topics were high level, indicating limited hands-on experience. She has no GitLab experience but is familiar with Jenkins, and hasnâ€™t worked with observability tools like Grafana or Dynatrace. Overall, while the candidate seems to have practical exposure in IAM/KMS, her broader AWS hands-on experience appears limited
