“The candidate had a good conversation overall and demonstrated familiarity with core AWS services, though hands-on experience appeared limited in several areas. He managed to answer questions on API Gateway and Lambda using general debugging approaches, but some responses remained high-level. IAM and KMS responses were solid, but logging and troubleshooting answers were vague despite prompting. Terraform knowledge was fair, but he missed common constructs like count and nested blocks, suggesting limited hands-on usage—though this may have been impacted by interview pressure. While he has no GitLab experience, he is familiar with other open-source CI/CD tools. Observability tools like Grafana and Dynatrace were known to him at a surface level. The candidate comes from a strong sysadmin background, showed good personality and adaptability, and may be a good fit for a learning-focused role where AWS skills can be deepened over time.
