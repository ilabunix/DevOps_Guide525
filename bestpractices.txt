During the initial solution design, the plan was for the legacy CloudFront URLs to continue serving SAC downloads while Akamai handled the redirection to the new GovCloud-hosted endpoints. This approach was discussed at the architecture level, and the redirect setup was expected to be part of the Akamai configuration scope.

The formal work request for that redirect should have been initiated by the Solution Architect or project team during those early design phases, since it involved changes on the Akamai edge and coordination with their delivery configuration team. However, that step was never formally submitted, so the redirect wasn’t implemented before testing.

When we started UAT validation, I raised this gap and confirmed that Akamai didn’t have the redirect configured, which is why the legacy CloudFront URLs were returning access errors. We’ve since discussed it with Akamai, and they confirmed that implementing the redirect on their edge requires additional setup that can’t be completed before the 11/16 go-live.

For now, the redirect will be handled post go-live by Akamai, and CloudFront will remain unchanged to stay aligned with the current change-freeze window.
