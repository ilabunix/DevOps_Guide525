We received a CloudWatch alarm for Bloomreach delivery node-01 due to an EC2 status check failure, and the ALB target group is reporting the instance as Unhealthy (502 Bad Gateway).

I connected through SSM to validate the instance, and the following was observed:
	•	The instance’s uptime is very recent, indicating it was restarted or experienced an underlying host issue.
	•	Local health check endpoint (curl https://localhost/ping -k) is returning a 502 Bad Gateway, which confirms the application on this node is not serving traffic correctly.
	•	In the target group, this instance is failing health checks consistently with HTTP 502 while the second node remains healthy.

Given the node is in an unrecoverable/unhealthy state and part of an Auto Scaling Group, the appropriate action is to terminate the instance so the ASG can launch a fresh replacement node. This will allow a new healthy instance to register back into the target group.
