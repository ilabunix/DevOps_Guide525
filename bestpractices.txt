🎥 GenAI CloudOps Assistant – 3-Minute Demo Script

[0:00 – 0:20] – Introduction

“Hi everyone, this is a quick demo of the CloudOps AI Assistant, a GenAI-powered chatbot we built to help engineers troubleshoot cloud issues faster using AWS-native services.
The goal of this POC is to show how AI can retrieve relevant operational guidance from our existing playbooks and reduce mean time to resolution during incidents.”

[0:20 – 1:00] – Problem Context

“Today, engineers spend a lot of time manually searching through Confluence pages, logs, and tickets during incidents.
This chatbot changes that by providing an intelligent, conversational interface — so engineers can simply ask questions like ‘What caused the recent Lambda outage?’ or ‘How do I resolve API Gateway 4XX errors?’ and get contextual responses instantly.”

(Optional visual: show your chat UI or API Gateway endpoint page on screen.)

[1:00 – 2:00] – Solution Walkthrough

“Let me show you how it works.
The chatbot uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation architecture hosted entirely in AWS.
Here’s the workflow:
	1.	The query Lambda receives the user’s question through API Gateway.
	2.	It retrieves relevant information from a vector search index in OpenSearch Serverless, which stores embeddings generated using Amazon Titan.
	3.	The retrieved context is passed to Claude Sonnet in AWS Bedrock, which generates a structured and conversational response.
	4.	The response is then displayed here in the chat interface hosted on S3.”

(Show example question → response, e.g. “What was the cause of the last outage for SRAP?” and display Claude’s structured answer.)

“Notice how it summarizes the incident, provides cause, resolution steps, and even references the original playbook.”

[2:00 – 2:40] – Key Benefits

“This POC demonstrates several key benefits:
	•	It reduces MTTR by surfacing the right answers instantly.
	•	It ensures consistency in troubleshooting, since the responses come from validated internal playbooks.
	•	And it keeps all data inside AWS, ensuring compliance and FedRAMP alignment — there’s no external data transfer.”

(Optional visual: show architecture diagram or AWS console components — S3, OpenSearch, Lambda, API Gateway.)

[2:40 – 3:00] – Closing

“In summary, the CloudOps AI Assistant shows how GenAI can make our operations more efficient, resilient, and knowledge-driven.
This POC lays the groundwork for a scalable solution that can eventually integrate across all our operational teams and systems.”
“Thank you for watching.”

🎤 Pro Tips for Recording
	•	Open with your chat interface and end with the architecture diagram or AWS console view.
	•	Keep the tone natural and professional, not robotic — think executive demo rather than tutorial.
	•	Ideal flow: Problem → Demo → Architecture → Benefits → Closing.
	•	If possible, record with your webcam off but keep clear audio.
