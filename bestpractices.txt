CloudOps AI Assistant – Intelligent Troubleshooting and Knowledge Retrieval

⸻

Headline & Problem to Solve

Cloud operations engineers spend significant time manually searching through Confluence pages, historical tickets, and dashboards to resolve incidents or identify recurring issues. This manual approach delays recovery, leads to inconsistent responses, and depends heavily on individual knowledge.

The CloudOps AI Assistant leverages Generative AI to make troubleshooting faster, smarter, and standardized. It enables engineers to ask natural-language questions and receive contextual, step-by-step responses drawn directly from vetted Confluence playbooks and runbooks.

The assistant uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture built entirely on AWS. It indexes Confluence content into a secure OpenSearch vector store, uses Amazon Titan for embeddings, and Claude Sonnet via AWS Bedrock for generating accurate, human-like responses — all within FedRAMP-compliant boundaries.

Risks & Mitigations

Existing Risk 1: AI may retrieve outdated or irrelevant Confluence content.
Mitigation: Scheduled content re-indexing and filtering by Confluence space/version metadata.

Existing Risk 2: Unauthorized data access from restricted Confluence pages.
Mitigation: Integration uses Confluence API tokens with scoped permissions; IAM roles enforce access boundaries.

Existing Risk 3: User adoption challenges.
Mitigation: Provide hands-on demos and show measurable MTTR improvements to drive engagement.
